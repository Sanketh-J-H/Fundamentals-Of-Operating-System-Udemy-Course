Subject: Issues with Assigned Colleague on iWave Project

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to bring to your attention some concerns I have regarding the communication and collaboration with the individual you have assigned to work with me on the iWave project.

Firstly, I am finding it difficult to properly communicate and coordinate with this person. I would appreciate if you could please assign the tasks directly to us, as I do not feel comfortable being "bossed around" by an intern.

Additionally, this individual seems to constantly argue with me (and sometimes others) over even the smallest of matters. The lack of respect shown in the communication is also concerning and is hampering our ability to make progress on the project.

I understand the importance of this project and am committed to its success. However, the issues I have outlined are making it challenging to work effectively. I would be grateful if you could please look into this matter and consider reassigning the tasks or providing guidance to ensure a more collaborative and respectful working relationship.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am available to discuss this further if needed.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
